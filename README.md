# jsonconvert

Converts weird blog JSON to HTML.

## How to Use

- By file:
  - Execute `jsonconvert.py`
  - Enter the path to the input file
  - Enter the path to the output file
    - This is optional: leaving this blank results in an output file of "`input-file`_out.html"
- Through UI:
  - Execute `jsonconvert_ui.py`
  - Paste the JSON into the left text field
  - Press "Convert" or type "ctrl+enter"
